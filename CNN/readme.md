# 🧠 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

In this folder, we will focus on building various **deep learning projects** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** — one of the most powerful and widely used architectures for image-related tasks such as classification, detection, and recognition.

CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through backpropagation, using multiple building blocks such as **convolution layers**, **pooling layers**, and **fully connected layers**.

## 🔍 What We’ve Done So Far

We have already built a **Binary Soil Image Prediction** project using a **basic Sequential CNN model**.

- The model classifies soil images into **two categories (binary classification)**.  
- It applies **convolution** and **pooling operations** to extract essential visual features.  
- The extracted features are passed through **dense layers** for final classification.

This project served as our introduction to the core concepts and implementation of CNNs.

## 🚀 What’s Next

In this folder, we’ll continue exploring CNNs with more advanced and diverse projects, including:

- **Advanced Architectures**: Implement models such as VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet.  
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Build models that can classify images into multiple categories.  
- **Object Detection and Segmentation**: Learn to identify and localize multiple objects within images.  
- **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained CNNs to boost performance on smaller datasets.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply transformations to increase dataset variety and improve generalization.  
- **Feature Visualization**: Explore how CNNs “see” and learn features from images.

## 🎯 Goal

By the end of this module, we aim to:
- Understand the internal workings of CNN layers.
- Build robust CNN models for real-world computer vision tasks.
- Gain hands-on experience with TensorFlow/Keras CNN implementations.
