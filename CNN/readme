<h1 align="center">🧠 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</h1>

---

Welcome to the **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** projects folder!  
Here, we explore deep learning architectures designed for **image-based tasks** — including **classification**, **object detection**, and **segmentation**.

CNNs are powerful because they automatically **extract and learn features** from images using multiple specialized layers such as **Convolution**, **Pooling**, and **Dense** layers.

## 🔷 <span style="font-size:1.4em;">CNN Architecture Overview</span>

A simplified representation of how data flows through a CNN model 👇
         ┌─────────────────────────────┐
         │         🖼️ Input Image        │
         └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                        │
               ▼ Convolution Layer
                        │
               ▼ Activation (ReLU)
                        │
               ▼ Pooling Layer
                        │
               ▼ Convolution + Pooling
                        │
               ▼ Flatten Layer
                        │
               ▼ Fully Connected (Dense)
                        │
               ▼ Output Layer (Softmax / Sigmoid)

> 🧠 **Insight:**  
> Early layers detect edges and colors.  
> Deeper layers learn shapes and complex visual patterns.
